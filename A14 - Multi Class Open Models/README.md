# Multi-class Open Models Analysis
___

### Overview

This report analyzes the performance of a production/packaging facility handling three types of products (three classes). Each product class has unique characteristics in terms of raw part arrivals, assembly, and handling times. During the packaging stage, defective products are sent back to the production stage with class-dependent probabilities.

The following analysis includes:

1. **Utilization of the two stations.**
2. **Average number of jobs in the system for each type of product (class c - Nc).**
3. **Average system response time per product type (class c - Rc).**
4. **Class-independent average number of jobs in the system (N).**
5. **Class-independent average system response time (R).**
