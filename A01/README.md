### Overview
The enclosed files [Logger1.csv](Logger1.csv) and [Logger2.csv](Logger2.csv) are two log files taken from a sensor monitoring the flow of cars in a traffic road section. Cars first pass through the first sensor, then through the second. The road segment is single lane, so no overtaking is possible. The values are expressed in minutes.
