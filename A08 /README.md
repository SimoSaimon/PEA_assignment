The analysis aims to evaluate various performance metrics of the concert based on the playlist behavior.

The following metrics are analyzed:

1. The probability that a patron hears a specific song when randomly entering the concert.
2. The average cost of songs played during a concert.
3. The number of shows that could be played per day and the average duration of each concert.
